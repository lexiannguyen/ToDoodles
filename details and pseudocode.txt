some details: ⁽˙̄˟˙̄⁾
  - plant, a must. 
    > a fern, perhaps? 
    > an onion. 
    > a marble queen pothos. 
    > the one that closes when you touch it.. touchmenot or something; could have it slowly open up instead of grow idkidk oooh yeah that sounds nice, or we could do a flower blooming or a fruit growing

  - display a list of tasks
    > title of task
    > due dates
    > subject/period
    > type of work (hw, test, project, etc.)
    > status of completion? (not started, in progress, completed) 
    
    Where do you guys want to store this data (MongoDB, Txt File, Json File)

  - Implement a timer for each of the tasks
  - A custom ringtone after a timer goes off
  - a reminder maybe? oo desktop notif? 

  - maybe have a minigame after a task is completed if we finish the project early... 
    > can use the snake game / turtle racer we made

- have a selection screen? 
  > 1. add assignment
  > 2. see planner/to-do list
  > 3. plant
  > 4.
